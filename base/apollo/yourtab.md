#### <font size = 4>*All Your Work in One Place*</font>
<font class = "yourtab-body">Save all your code and modules under the Apollo Mission. Starting side projects inside Shuttle makes it easy to switch between projects, connect projects to one another, and manage your code in a Git repository.</font>

#### <font size = 4>*Always Building Up*</font>
<font class = "yourtab-body">Don't underestimate the power of having all your hard work in one spot - particularly as a beginner. It is much easier to bring yourself back to a side project when you feel like you are continuously improving upon it and - when all your work is in one place - it is much easier to see progress as well. Shuttle is all about building up and keeping you motivated.

<font class = "yourtab-body">The Shiny package gives us an easy way to build our own custom web applications. This will be way more fun than learning the traditional way.</font>
