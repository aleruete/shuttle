Shuttle is a Shiny application designed to guide beginners in the world of data science and programming.

#### Coding Languages Used
Most of Shuttle is written in R, however we will also dabble in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to make our modules super dope!

#### Organizing Your Work
Don't underestimate the power of having all your hard work in one spot. Keeping all your modules inside Shuttle makes it easy to switch between projects, connect modules to one another, publish your work, and manage your code in a Git repository.

#### What is Data Science?
The growth of data is staggering. Every business is finding ways to collect more data about their customers, their products, and their own operations. Data scientists help a business analyze that data, create solutions, and present their findings. All of this requires code.

#### Why Shiny?
The R Shiny package gives us an easy way to build our own custom web applications. In fact, Shiny is so easy that we will use it to learn programming and data science while at the same time creating interactive apps. This will be way more fun than learning the traditional way. 

So let's start building in Shuttle and begin our data science journey.

A more traditional approach would be saying, ‘We’re going to teach all about screwdrivers and wrenches.’ This is a very difficult way to do it. A much better way would be, like, ‘Here’s the engine. Now let’s take it apart. How are we gonna take it apart? Oh you need a screwdriver!’" - Elon Musk*</font>
