# Shuttle
A place for getting excited and curious about data science! For all the videos that go along with the lessons, visit [Shuttle Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHIge2lulmLXhEhWpajOT3Q) on YouTube.

### How To Use
* Fork your own version of the repository. Look for the word "Fork" above the Settings tab.
* Watch the YouTube videos!
* In general, don't make changes to any of the following. You can if you want but those changes may get squashed when a new version of Shuttle is released.
    * anything in the 'base' folder
    * ui.R, server.R, global.R, login.R

### Version 0.1
This is a very early version of this project. All suggestions for improvements are welcome. :)
